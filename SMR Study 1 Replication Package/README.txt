FOLDER DESCRIPTIONS
/data
Contains cleaned data generated by the do-files.

/data/rawdata
Contains raw data in .csv files. This includes digital trace data ("activity_data.csv") collected by the interactive digital resume; website display data ("resume_data.csv") that include the unique codes linking survey and digital trace data, as well as characteristics of the resumes shown; and survey data ("prolific_pretest_data.csv," "prolific_data_part1.csv," "prolific_data_part2.csv," and "qualtrics_data.xlsx"). The Prolific data include the unique participant ID numbers assigned by Prolific and data on whether their survey was approved (if not, they returned the survey themselves, timed out, or were rejected). There are multiple Prolific data files because (1) some participants who participated in the pretest also participated in the main survey though they should have been prevented from doing so, meaning we need to drop the data for these participants; and (2) we collected the main survey data in two rounds due to an error from Prolific during the first round that meant we needed to drop some participants and thus collect more data. The Qualtrics data include the linking code as entered by participants, their Prolific participant ID, the job type condition they were assigned to (remote, hybrid, or in-person), the gender condition they were assigned to (viewing either women or men job candidates), and whether they were a "good complete" on the survey (i.e., completed the survey and were not terminated).

/do
Contains Stata do files to clean and analyze the data. See below for file run order.

/do/log
Contains Stata log files, which are recorded each time you run a Stata do file.

/output
Contains output from analysis (i.e, the figure shown in the paper).


DATA CLEANING AND ANALYSIS FILES TO RUN IN ORDER
Note: to run the do-files you must update line 20 in each file with the filepath for your working directory.
Software: Stata version 15.1.

/do/01_clean_resume_data.do
Cleans "resume" data, which are the randomized attributes shown in the interactive digital resumes. In the raw "resume" data, each observation corresponds to one of the two resumes that each participant viewed. Variables include a unique id provided to each participant in this study, the signaled identities on that resume (parent, non parent, woman, man), and the resume order number (which candidate was shown first). We clean this dataset by updating the "userid" to ensure no nonstandard characters are included, applying value labels to the variables, and then saving the dataset in .dta format for further use in the fourth do-file.

/do/02_clean_activity_data.do
Cleans "activity" data, which are digital trace data generated by survey participants' interactions with the digital resume. In the raw "activity" data, each observation corresponds to one documented digital activity (e.g., a click; does not include mouse movements). Variables include the unique user ID, the time of the activity, a description of the activity, and the resume that the participant was viewing. We clean this dataset by updating the "userid" to ensure no nonstandard characters are included and format the timing variables for analysis. We save these data in .dta format for further use in the fourth do-file.

/do/03_clean_survey_data.do
Cleans the "survey" data, which are Prolific and Qualtrics data as described above under /data/rawdata. We clean these data by preparing the participant id variables, appending the multiple Prolific datasets, labeling the variables for the Qualtrics data, and saving these data in .dta format for further use in the fourth do-file.

/do/04_merge_data.do
Merges the datasets created by prior do-files into one file, identifies the analytic sample, and reshapes the data long so that each observation is a record for one job candidate/resume rather than one survey participant (each participant viewed/evaluated two resumes). It also generates the outcome variable (time spent on the resume in deciles) for analysis. The final product of this do-file is the primary dataset for analysis by the next do-file.

/do/05_analyze.do
Uses the analytic sample dataset produced by the prior do-file to analyze the timing digital trace data and generate the figure shown in the paper.
