FOLDERS DESCRIPTIONS
/data
Contains cleaned data generated by the do-files.

/data/rawdata
Contains raw data. This includes digital trace data ("activity_data.csv") collected by the interactive digital resume; website display data ("resume_data.csv") that include the unique codes linking survey and digital trace data, as well as characteristics of the resumes shown; and survey data ("survey_data.xlsx").

/data/images
Contains screenshots of example resumes -- by gender, parental status, and open section.

/do
Contains Stata do-files to clean and analyze the data. See below for file run order.

/do/log
Contains Stata log files, which are recorded each time you run a Stata do-file.

/R
Contains R file.

/output
Contains output from analyses (i.e., mouse movement heatmaps corresponding to the Online Supplement).


DATA CLEANING AND ANALYSIS FILES TO RUN IN ORDER
Note: Users must update the relative file paths at the top of each do-file or R file.
Software: Stata version 15.1; R version ####.

/do/01_clean_resume_data.do
Cleans "resume" data. In the raw "resume" data, each observation corresponds to one of the two resumes that each participant viewed. Variables include a code, which is a unique id provided to each participant in this study, the signaled identities on that resume (parent, non parent, woman, man), and the resume order number. We clean this dataset by updating the code to ensure no nonstandard characters are included, applying value labels to the variables, and then saving the dataset in .dta and .csv formats for further use.

/do/02_clean_activity_data.do
Cleans "activity" data, which are digital trace data generated by survey participants' interactions with the digital resume. In the raw "activity" data, each observation corresponds to one documented digital activity (e.g., a click; does not include mouse movements). Variables include the code uniquely identifying participants, the time of the activity, a description of the activity, and the resume that the participant was viewing. Variables include the unique user ID, the time of the activity, a description of the activity, and the resume that the participant was viewing. We clean this dataset by updating the code to ensure no nonstandard characters are included and format the timing variables for analysis. We save these data in .dta format for further use.

/do/03_clean_mouse_data.do
Cleans "mouse" data, which are digital trace data tracking participants' mouse movements as they interacted with the digital resumes. In the raw "mouse" data, each observation corresponds to one documented mouse location. Variables include the code uniquely identifying participants, the x and y coordinates of the mouse track, the time of the mouse track, and the resume the participant was looking at. We clean this dataset by updating the code to ensure no nonstandard characters are included, merging the dataset with data on which section was open at any given time, creating a new section status variable, and then saving the final dataset in .dta and .csv format for further use.

/do/04_clean_survey_data.do
Cleans survey data. These survey data are recorded using Qualtrics and include the unique code (used to link digital trace and survey data) as entered by participants, the accountability vs. control treatment they were assigned to, the gender condition they were assigned to (viewing either women or men job candidates), and whether they were a "good complete" on the survey (i.e., completed the survey and were not terminated).

/do/04_analyze_mouse_data.do
Analyzes mouse data. This loads the cleaned mouse data, merges with codes that are included in our analytic sample, then runs OLS regressions predicting mouse tracks for each cell depending on whether the resume was for a parent or non parent and woman or man. Analyses are run separately for women and men candidates and for each possible section open. Summary tables which include the coefficient on parent, standard error, p values, stars, and sample size for each analysis are produced in the output folder.

/R/01_create_mouse_heatmaps.R
Demonstrates how we can create heat maps of mouse tracking. The file outputs only the figures that we use in the article. We slightly changed the base image to improve accessibility when combined with heat map shading (i.e., removed the gray outline around the resume, so that darker shading on the resume is not confused with darker shading of the heat map).
